simple english to arabic translation program

having created a text file that includes an english word with its corresponding arabic translation, the program reads the text file and creates a HashMap. The majority of the code revolved around the computer reading the text file and pairing the write words together (due to inconsistent spacing and white space between sets). The program is created to be not case sensitive.
